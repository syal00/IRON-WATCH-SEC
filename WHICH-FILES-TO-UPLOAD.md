# Which Files to Upload? (Simple Guide)

## ✅ YOU ONLY NEED 4 THINGS!

Don't worry about all the files in your project. For GoDaddy hosting, you only need:

### Essential Files (Upload These):
1. ✅ **index.html** - Your main website page
2. ✅ **styles.css** - All your website styles
3. ✅ **script.js** - Website functionality
4. ✅ **images/** folder - Your logo and images

**That's it! Just 4 items!**

## 📁 What Your Upload Should Look Like

When you upload to `public_html`, it should look like this:

```
public_html/
├── index.html          ← Upload this
├── styles.css          ← Upload this
├── script.js           ← Upload this
└── images/             ← Upload this entire folder
    ├── mainlogo.png
    ├── logo.svg
    └── (any other images you have)
```

**Total: 3 files + 1 folder = 4 items to upload**

## 📍 Where to Find Your Files

Your project folder structure probably looks like this:

```
IRON WATCH SECURITY Inc/
├── index.html          ✅ UPLOAD THIS
├── styles.css          ✅ UPLOAD THIS
├── script.js           ✅ UPLOAD THIS
├── images/             ✅ UPLOAD THIS FOLDER
│   ├── mainlogo.png

├── components/         ❌ DON'T UPLOAD

├── *.md files          ❌ DON'T UPLOAD
└── (other files)       ❌ DON'T UPLOAD
```

**Just grab the 4 items marked with ✅**

## 🚀 Simple Upload Steps

1. **Open File Manager in cPanel**
2. **Go to `public_html` folder**
3. **Click "Upload"**
4. **Select these 4 items:**
   - `index.html`
   - `styles.css`
   - `script.js`
   - `images/` folder
5. **Click "Upload"**
6. **Done!**

**That's it! You don't need to upload anything else.**

## 💡 Why Only These Files?

- **index.html** = Your website page (what visitors see)
- **styles.css** = Makes your website look good (colors, fonts, layout)
- **script.js** = Makes your website work (forms, animations, etc.)
- **images/** = Your logo and pictures

Everything else is either:
- Development files (Next.js, React - not needed for static site)
- Documentation (helpful for you, but not needed on website)
- Configuration files (for development, not needed on server)

---

## ✅ Final Check

Before uploading, make sure you have:
- [ ] `index.html` file
- [ ] `styles.css` file
- [ ] `script.js` file
- [ ] `images/` folder with images inside

**If you have these 4 items, you're ready to upload!**

**Don't worry about all the other files - just upload these 4 essential items!** 🎉
